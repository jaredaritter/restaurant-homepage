# Restaurant Homepage

- TOP project to build a restaurant homepage. Project contains Homepage, Menu, and Contact pages for a latin food restaurant.

## Project Details

- Focus: Use of modules and javascript to implement page changes instead of links
- Practical example and single responsibility through modules
- Used object literal to hold page all page information and then parsed it out and printed using modules
- Refactoring focused on implementation and use of dev tools to streamline workflow as well as practice reuse of modules
  - Contact page used as sandbox for testing different ways of parsing and rendering page data
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) used to simplify workflow

## To Do and Thoughts

- There is plenty of room to flesh out this project in terms of content and styling. At this time it is best to move on and focus on other learning objectives
- This was a useful project in that it allowed application of modules which were somewhat confusing at the time the project was given.
  - I have been able to come back to it feeling more comfortable with the module approach and apply techniques from other lessons.

## Future Learning

- Currently bias towards using functions for secondary effects with limited direct use of returns. Could use more information on proper module construction/technique.
  - \*Deliberate practice used on return to project to utilize returns for contact page parsing and rendering
- Take a look at my modules and other student's projects for ideas on how to improve organization, use of public functions, and function returns after working a few sections ahead
