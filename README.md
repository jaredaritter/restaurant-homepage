# Restaurant Homepage
* Homepage, Menu, and Contact pages
* Content currently boilerplate

## Project Details
* Focus: Use of modules and javascript to implement page changes instead of links
* Practical example in seperation of concerns and single responsibility through modules
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) used to simplify workflow and learn basic dev tools

## To Do and Thoughts
* Flesh out:
    * Styling
    * Menu options with images
    * contact page

## Future Learning
    * Currently bias towards using functions for secondary effects with limited direct use of returns. Could use more information on proper module construction/technique 
    * Take a look at my modules and other student's projects for ideas on how to improve organization, use of public functions, and function returns after working a few sections ahead
