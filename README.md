# Restaurant Homepage
* Homepage, Menu, and Contact pages
* Most content currently boilerplate

## Project Details
* Focused use of modules and javascript to implement page changes instead of links

## To Do and Thoughts
* Flesh out:
    * Styling
    * Menu options with images
    * contact page
* Currently making poor/limited use of returns and could use more information on proper module construction/technique 
    * Take a look at my modules and other student's projects for ideas on how to improve use of public functions and returns
